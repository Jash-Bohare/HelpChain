# üöÄ HelpChain

> Transparent Blockchain-Powered Donation Platform on Stellar

---

## üìå Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 6 ‚Äì Better Finance for Everyone with Stellar**

---

## üéØ Objective

HelpChain addresses the lack of transparency in charitable donations by providing a blockchain-based donation platform built on the Stellar Testnet. It serves donors who want assurance that their contributions are reaching verified NGOs and NGOs who need a trustworthy way to receive and track funds.

Through OTP-based wallet creation, real-time transaction history, and blockchain immutability, HelpChain ensures that every fund transfer is visible, traceable, and tamper-proof‚Äîrestoring donor confidence and promoting financial accountability in the non-profit sector.

### Your Approach:  
We chose this problem because traditional donation platforms often lack transparency, making it difficult for donors to trust where their money is going. We wanted to solve this using Stellar‚Äôs decentralized and low-cost infrastructure.

The main challenges included integrating Stellar with Firebase Realtime Database, handling key security responsibly, and ensuring users could easily understand and interact with blockchain tech‚Äîespecially those unfamiliar with wallets or XLM.

One key breakthrough was implementing OTP-based wallet creation, which made onboarding smoother. We also pivoted from building multi-chain support to focusing entirely on Stellar, which offered a faster, simpler, and more reliable testnet experience during the hackathon.
