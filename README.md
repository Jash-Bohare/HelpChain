# üöÄ HelpChain

> Transparent Blockchain-Powered Donation Platform on Stellar

---

## üìå Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 6 ‚Äì Better Finance for Everyone with Stellar**

---

## üéØ Objective

HelpChain addresses the lack of transparency in charitable donations by providing a blockchain-based donation platform built on the Stellar Testnet. It serves donors who want assurance that their contributions are reaching verified NGOs and NGOs who need a trustworthy way to receive and track funds.

Through OTP-based wallet creation, real-time transaction history, and blockchain immutability, HelpChain ensures that every fund transfer is visible, traceable, and tamper-proof‚Äîrestoring donor confidence and promoting financial accountability in the non-profit sector.

### Our Approach:  
- We chose this problem to address the lack of transparency and trust in charitable donations, especially in regions where digital accountability is limited.

- Our goal was to build a platform that uses blockchain for traceability while being simple enough for anyone to use, even without prior crypto knowledge.

- Key challenges we faced included:
a) Seamless Stellar wallet integration with Firebase and user auth
b) Handling secret key security and safe storage
c) Fetching and displaying transaction history with readable names

- One major breakthrough was building an OTP-based wallet system, making it safer and user-friendly.
